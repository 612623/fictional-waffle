### 1. Executive Summary & Vision
This document outlines the requirements for the Waffle Suite Platform Onboarding Tool, a new module designed to streamline and standardize the new-hire onboarding process. The vision is to create a centralized, automated, and engaging experience that accelerates new employee time-to-productivity, reduces administrative overhead for HR and hiring managers, and reinforces company culture from day one. This initiative will enhance operational efficiency and directly contribute to improved employee retention and satisfaction.

### 2. The Problem Statement
Currently, the new-hire onboarding process is manual, fragmented, and inconsistent across departments. This results in a disjointed experience for new employees, a significant administrative burden on the HR team (estimated at 15-20 hours per new hire), and a lack of visibility for managers into their new team members' progress. This inefficiency leads to a slower ramp-up period, potential disengagement, and a measurable 15% drop-off in employee satisfaction scores within the first 90 days. The absence of a centralized system makes it difficult to track completion, ensure compliance, and gather data to improve the process.

### 3. Personas & Scenarios
#### 3.1 Persona Details
*   **Emily Johnson (New Hire):** A recently hired Software Engineer. Emily is eager to make a positive impact but feels overwhelmed by the volume of information. She seeks clear, structured guidance on her role, the company culture, and her initial tasks to feel confident and integrated.
*   **Michael Smith (HR Manager):** Responsible for onboarding 20-30 new hires per quarter. Michael is currently burdened by repetitive, manual tasks such as sending welcome emails, tracking paperwork, and answering duplicative questions. He needs an automated system to manage onboarding at scale, ensure consistency, and collect feedback for continuous process improvement.
*   **Sarah Lee (Hiring Manager):** A Director of Engineering with a growing team. Sarah is time-constrained and needs an efficient way to monitor her new hire's progress, provide necessary resources, and ensure they are successfully integrating. She requires high-level summaries and actionable insights, not another complex tool to manage.

### 4. Goals & Success Metrics
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the corporate onboarding process. Success will be measured against the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

| Goal | Metric | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Accelerate New Hire Time-to-Productivity** | Reduce the average time to complete the mandatory 30-day onboarding checklist. | 20% reduction within 6 months of launch. |
| **2. Reduce HR Administrative Overhead** | Decrease the number of manual hours HR spends per new hire on administrative tasks. | 40% reduction (from 15 to 9 hours) in the first quarter post-launch. |
| **3. Improve New Hire Satisfaction** | Increase the "Onboarding Experience" score in the 30-day new hire feedback survey. | Improve average score from 7.5/10 to 8.5/10. |
| **4. Enhance Managerial Engagement** | Increase the adoption and usage of onboarding tools by hiring managers. | Achieve 85% weekly active usage of the manager progress dashboard for all managers with active new hires. |

### 9. Appendix & Open Questions
