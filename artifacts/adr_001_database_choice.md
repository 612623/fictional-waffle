# Vector Database Selection for Semantic Search in SaaS Web Application

## Status
Accepted â€“ 2024-06-10

## Context

As part of enhancing our SaaS web application, we require a solution to support semantic search capabilities using vector similarity search. The application must manage both traditional relational data (e.g., user onboarding, workflow management) and moderate-scale vector data (e.g., text embeddings for search and recommendations). The engineering team predominantly uses Python with Django/FastAPI, and operational simplicity, reliability, and maintainability are key priorities.

We evaluated two primary approaches for storing and querying vector data:

1. **PostgreSQL with pgvector extension:** Enables native storage and search of vector embeddings within a standard PostgreSQL database, supporting both relational and vector use cases in a unified system.
2. **Specialized vector databases (ChromaDB, FAISS):** Designed for high-throughput, large-scale vector search, supporting state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms with horizontal scalability.

Key comparative factors included scalability, ease of use and integration, operational maturity, community support, and fit with our technology stack and team expertise.

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension** as our primary data store for both relational and vector data.

**Rationale:**

- **Unified Architecture:** Storing both relational and vector data in the same database greatly simplifies operational overhead (backups, monitoring, scaling, security, and access control) and reduces cognitive load for the engineering team.
- **Integration with Existing Stack:** PostgreSQL is already well-supported within our Django/FastAPI stack, with ORM support, migrations, and admin tooling readily available. pgvector is mature, actively maintained, and widely adopted.
- **Operational Maturity:** PostgreSQL offers robust transactional guarantees, backup and recovery, and mature scaling strategies for our expected workload (<10M vectors), with broad cloud provider support.
- **Sufficient Performance:** For our anticipated moderate-scale vector search workloads, PostgreSQL with pgvector provides acceptable performance and scalability. Advanced vector-specific features (e.g., HNSW, IVFFlat) are available for optimizing search queries.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** Both PostgreSQL and pgvector benefit from extensive documentation, community support, and a wide range of integrations, reducing maintenance risk and enabling rapid troubleshooting.

Specialized vector databases (ChromaDB/FAISS) were considered but deprioritized due to their lack of transactional guarantees, need for polyglot persistence, and higher integration and operational complexity for typical SaaS web applications.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**

- **Simplified Operations:** One database system for both relational and vector data reduces infrastructure complexity, streamlines deployments, and unifies monitoring and backup strategies.
- **Developer Productivity:** Familiar tools (Django ORM, migrations, admin) accelerate development and onboarding.
- **Maintainability:** Mature ecosystem and community support minimize long-term maintenance burden and risk.
- **Sufficient Vector Search:** For our use case (moderate dataset size, typical SaaS workloads), vector search performance is acceptable and can be tuned as needs grow.

**Negative Outcomes:**

- **Scalability Limitations:** For very large-scale or high-concurrency vector search workloads (e.g., >100M vectors, low-latency ML inference), PostgreSQL may not match the performance of specialized vector databases.
- **Manual Tuning:** Indexing and query optimization for vector search may require additional expertise and maintenance.
- **Feature Gaps:** Lacks some advanced vector-specific capabilities (e.g., auto-sharding, distributed vector search, real-time index updates) present in dedicated vector engines.
- **Potential Migration:** If vector workloads become dominant or outgrow PostgreSQL's capabilities, migration to a specialized vector store may become necessary in the future.

Overall, this decision provides the most balanced and maintainable approach for current and foreseeable product requirements, while leaving a path open for future migration to specialized solutions if needed.
