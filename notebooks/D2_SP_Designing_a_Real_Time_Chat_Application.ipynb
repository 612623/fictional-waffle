In this lab, you will practice using an LLM to generate two different types of diagrams for a common software system: a real-time chat application. This will help you become more fluent in prompting for and interpreting diagrams-as-code."

    "\n",
    "The technique you're using in this lab‚Äîgenerating PlantUML or Mermaid code from a prompt‚Äîis a form of **\"Diagrams as Code.\"** This is a powerful, modern practice with several key advantages over using traditional drag-and-drop GUI tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Controllable:** Since the diagram is just a text file, you can check it into Git, review changes in pull requests, and track its history alongside your application code.\n",
    "- **Easily Editable:** Modifying a relationship or adding a component is as simple as changing a line of text. This is often much faster than fiddling with boxes and arrows in a GUI.\n",
    "- **Consistent:** Templates and code generation ensure that all diagrams across your organization can share a consistent style and level of detail.\n",
    "- **Automatable:** Because it's text, you can build tools that automatically generate or update architecture diagrams as part of your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring your documentation never goes stale."

    "1.  **State the Format:** Begin by clearly stating you want `PlantUML code for a component diagram`.\n",

    "3.  **Describe the Relationships:** Clearly describe the connections *between* the components. Use directional language like \"Component A sends data to Component B via HTTPS.\"\n",

    "Great work! In this practice lab, you have reinforced your ability to use an LLM to generate different types of architectural diagrams from a text description. You created both a static component diagram showing the system's structure and a dynamic sequence diagram showing a key user interaction. This skill is invaluable for quickly communicating complex designs to your team."
