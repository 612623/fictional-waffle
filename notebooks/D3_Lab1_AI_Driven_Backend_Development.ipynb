    "**Objective:** Generate a complete FastAPI backend application, including Pydantic and SQLAlchemy models, and then perform the critical engineering task of integrating the generated code with the live SQLite database created on Day 2.\n",

    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to Day 3! With our requirements and architecture defined, it's time to write code. In this lab, you will act as a senior developer guiding an AI co-pilot. Your task is to generate the full backend API for the Onboarding Tool. This involves not just generating code, but also connecting it to the live database we created yesterday, moving from a prototype to a functional, data-driven application.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task:** This is the most critical engineering step of the lab. You will manually integrate the generated database code into the FastAPI application, replacing the in-memory logic with live database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "This task represents a significant jump in complexity. Follow these steps carefully in your IDE (like VS Code):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a new, empty file named `app/main.py`.\n",
    "2.  **First, copy the Pydantic models and the `app = FastAPI()` line** from your `app/main_in_memory.py` file and paste them into `app/main.py`.\n",
    "3.  **Next, paste the SQLAlchemy model classes and the `get_db` dependency function** you generated in Challenge 2 into your new `app/main.py`.\n",
    "4.  **Now, let's refactor the `POST /users/` endpoint.** Copy the endpoint function from the in-memory file, but replace the in-memory logic (e.g., `db.append()`) with the correct SQLAlchemy session calls: `db.add(db_user)`, `db.commit()`, and `db.refresh(db_user)`.\n",
    "5.  Repeat this refactoring process for the other endpoints (GET, PUT, DELETE), replacing list manipulations with the appropriate SQLAlchemy `db.query()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task requires you to act as the senior developer, stitching together the AI-generated components into a functional, cohesive whole. You may need to ask the LLM follow-up questions like, \"How do I write a SQLAlchemy query to find a user by ID?\""

      "# Security Assessment Report: Waffle Tech Suite API\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "This security assessment of the Waffle Tech Suite API, a FastAPI application, evaluates its resilience against common web application vulnerabilities identified by OWASP. The application provides CRUD operations for managing users, roles, and tasks. The assessment covers areas such as injection vulnerabilities, authentication and authorization, input validation, data exposure, access control, security misconfigurations, database security, business logic vulnerabilities, API-specific vulnerabilities, and dependency management.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Critical Vulnerabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.1 Injection Vulnerabilities\n",
      "- **SQL Injection**: The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM, which inherently protects against SQL injection through parameterized queries. However, ensure that no raw SQL queries are introduced without proper parameterization.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Authentication and Authorization\n",
      "- **Authentication**: There is no authentication mechanism implemented. This exposes the API to unauthorized access.\n",
      "- **Authorization**: Lack of role-based access control for API endpoints allows unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. High Severity Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1 Data Exposure and Privacy\n",
      "- **API Response Data**: Potential over-exposure of user and role data through API responses. Sensitive information such as email addresses should be masked or omitted where appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2 Access Control Issues\n",
      "- **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**: Users can access other users' data without proper authorization checks, risking unauthorized data exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Medium Severity Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.1 Input Validation and Sanitization\n",
      "- **Format Validation**: While there is some format validation (e.g., email, date), more comprehensive validation and sanitization should be applied to all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Security Misconfiguration\n",
      "- **CORS Configuration**: The current configuration allows requests from any origin. This might expose the API to CSRF attacks. Consider restricting allowed origins to only trusted domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.3 Database Security\n",
      "- **Database Credentials**: Ensure that database credentials are not hardcoded and are securely stored, possibly using environment variables or a secrets management service.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Low Severity Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.1 API-Specific Vulnerabilities\n",
      "- **Rate Limiting**: There is no rate limiting implemented, exposing the API to potential DoS attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.2 Dependencies and Configuration\n",
      "- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Security Best Practices Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implement Authentication and Authorization**: Introduce a robust authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth2 or JWT) and enforce role-based access control to ensure that users only access resources they are authorized to.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhance Input Validation**: Apply strict validation and sanitization across all endpoints. Use libraries like `pydantic` validators to enforce data integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Restrict CORS Policy**: Limit CORS access to trusted domains only to mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Protect Sensitive Data**: Mask or omit sensitive data in API responses and secure all sensitive data at rest using encryption.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Introduce rate limiting to protect the API from abuse and potential denial of service attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Secure Database Credentials**: Use a secure method for storing and accessing database credentials, such as environment variables or a secrets management tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regular Dependency Audits**: Continuously monitor and audit dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `Snyk` or `Dependabot`.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Improve Error Handling**: Ensure error messages do not leak sensitive information. Implement a consistent logging mechanism that does not expose sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Security Headers**: Add security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options to enhance security.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **API Versioning**: Implement API versioning to manage changes better and ensure backward compatibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing best practices, the Waffle Tech Suite API can significantly improve its security posture and protect user data from potential threats.\n"

    "## Lab Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully generated and assembled a complete, database-connected backend API. You used an LLM to generate the boilerplate for both the API endpoints and the database models, and then performed the crucial engineering task of integrating them. You now have a working `main.py` file in your `app` directory that can create, read, update, and delete data in a live database. In the next lab, we will write a comprehensive test suite for this API.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** AI excels at generating boilerplate code (like models and endpoint structures), but the developer's critical role is in the final integration and wiring of these components into a coherent, working system."
